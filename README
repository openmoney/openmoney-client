== Welcome to rubycc

Quick Start    
	This quick-start is intended for developers and early adopters who want to get started running an open money client.

	Step 1: Install Prerequisites
		Ruby
		Database: You can use any database that Rails supports. We’ve been developing on MySQL 5
		Rails
		Subversion

	Step 2: Install rubycc
		Do an svn install from rubyforge with:
		svn checkout http://openmoney.rubyforge.org/svn/rubycc/trunk rubyom

		Then do the standard rails set-up actions, i.e.
		create a database “rubycc_development” (this will vary depending on which database you chose)
		edit config/database.yml with the database passwords and and setup according to which database you chose.

		Once you have set up the database then you can:
		cd rubycc
		rake db:migrate
		ruby script/server

	Step 3: Try it out!
		You should now have the client running an accessible at: localhost:3000

Note: the client out of the box assumes that you have installed the rubyom server and have it running on port 3001 for rubycc to work out of the box. See the rubyom project for details. If you want to point the client at a different server, click on config, and edit the “server” configuration.
