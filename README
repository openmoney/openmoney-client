== Welcome to openmoney-client

Quick Start    
	This quick-start is intended for developers and early adopters who want to get started running an open money client.

	Step 1: Install Prerequisites
		Ruby
		Database: You can use any database that Rails supports. We’ve been developing on MySQL 5
		Rails
		Git
		An installed version of openmoney-server running on some host

	Step 2: Install rubycc
		Clone the git repository with:
		git clone git://github.com/openmoney/openmoney-client.git

		Then do the standard rails set-up actions, i.e.
		create a database “omclient_development” (this will vary depending on which database you chose)
		cd config
		cp database_example.yml database_yml
		edit config/database.yml with the database passwords and and setup according to which database you chose.

		Once you have set up the database then you can:
		rake db:migrate
		ruby script/server

	Step 3: Configuration
		You should now have the client running an accessible at: localhost:3000
		Point your browser at http://localhost:3000 and click on "new user profile"
		The first profile that is created will be given admin privileges.  Click on the "config" menu to
		configure the client options, most importantly which server the client should connect to.  The
		default is http://localhost:3001.  Thus the assumption is that you have installed the openmoney-server
		and have it running on port 3001 . See the http://github.com/openmoney/openmoney-server for details.
